#CompuMusic

A dump of a bunch of Fruity Loops files, some are arrangements of Frank Zappa compositions imported from MIDI already on the Internet.

Others are originals.



##Fruity Loops
These were made with FLStudio on Windows XP (or possibly Wine, I can't recall) about ten years ago.

I have not yet tried loading them into the Android version, but I intend to soon.
